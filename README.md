# china-daily-email
compiles a summary of stories about china based on text file input

one-simple.py reads a single URL from a txt file and prints the headline and story

adder.py should be used to test new site configurations.

china-daily-email-stable.py is the current stable version

china-daily-eamil-worknig.py is used to integrate new sites

china-daily-email-local.py is the working version of the script modified to run locally (no email interface).  As of Jan 2017 this is the current version and the one that will be improved over time.  If you want to be able to use the new sources added to the headliner() function with china-daily-email-stable.py (if, for example, you want to keep using the email function) it is likely that you can just replace the headliner() section of china-daily-email-stable.py with the headliner() section from this script.
