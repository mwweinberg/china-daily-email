china-daily-email-local_short.py is the files that should provide the template for the new version of the email reader.  
It has updated how it parses the csv, how it sorts headlines/urls/body into dictionaries, and how it then writes various 
elements to the output file.  Hopefully, it also includes more helpful comments.

china-daily-emial-local_short_email.py is the curent version optimized to output to email instead of the text file

_author-date.py is used to try and add author and pub date fields

The X-learn.py files have basic operational elements for X to remember how to operate with them.
