China Policy Institute: The Internationalisation of Chinese NGOs
https://cpianalysis.org/2016/09/29/gongos-vs-ngos-the-internationalisation-of-chinese-ngos/

Written by Jennifer YJ Hsu.
There is increasing interest in China’s role as an international development actor due to its growing presence across the developing world, particularly in Africa. While much media attention and scholarly literature has focused on the role of Chinese trade and investments in the developing world, there is little research on the role played by Chinese non-governmental organisations. Although nascent, Chinese NGOs are beginning to internationalise their operations. Available literature indicates that it is largely government-organised NGOs (GONGOs) that have the capacity to expand their operations beyond China’s borders (Brenner 2012, Hsu et al. 2016). However, preliminary research and fieldwork with Chinese NGOs shows that smaller NGOs are beginning to look beyond the domestic realm, despite the well-documented challenges such as navigating state control or securing funding. In this piece I assess two different NGOs that have begun to internationalise their operations: the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) and Compassion for Migrant Children (CMC). The former, a GONGO, and the latter an NGO, have vastly different objectives, projects, and approaches to development.

Founded in 1989 and formerly known as the Foundation for Underdeveloped Regions in China, the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation is a GONGO that operates under the direction of the Office of Poverty Alleviation in the State Council. The CFPA implements various projects across China that are intended to address its main goal of poverty reduction. Its core projects include microfinancing, maternal and infant health programs, financing education for impoverished high school and university students, orphan sponsorship, community development, and disaster relief.
In 2011, the CFPA allocated a total of 1.09 billion RMB on its initiatives, with a total revenue of 1.35 billion (CFPA 2011) that came from donations in cash or kind (239.5 million RMB), investment returns (27.64 million RMB), and CFPA’s trust fund for microfinance (1.07 billion RMB) (CFPA 2011: 4). The centrepiece of the CFPA’s international development program is its China-Sudan Abu Ushar Friendship Hospital which was inaugurated in July 2011 and focuses on maternal and infant health. With an investment of US $1 million and a further $600,000 in donations from the China National Petroleum Corporation, the hospital has been called a “model for international cooperation” by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (CFPA 2011: 19).
The CFPA’s focus on infant and maternal health in Sudan—which has high mortality rates among both infants and mothers—is a natural reflection of the expertise it has spent the last 10 years developing in China. According to the CFPA’s deputy director, He Daofeng, the success of the CFPA’s infant and maternal programs in rural China provides the organisation with the experience needed to conduct its work in Sudan (quoted in China Development Brief 30 June 2011).
Compassion for Migrant Children is a Hong Kong-registered NGO that has worked with migrant children in Beijing since 2006, focusing on the social and academics aspects of their education. Similar to other NGOs, CMC’s programs are run by a pool of volunteers and trained staff members who conduct workshops for teachers at partner migrant schools in order to improve the quality and delivery of the education offered to migrant children. Furthermore, CMC work with parents in the community by providing parenting skills workshops. As noted by one of CMC’s senior representative, these programs are aimed at giving migrant children better home, school, and social environments. One CMC project that has garnered substantial domestic and international media attention has been its Community Cubes project, which takes old shipping containers and transforms then into transportable modular community centres. Given the transient nature of migrant communities, having easily transportable community centres saves time and money as it removes the need to find a location for CMC’s projects.
As part of its internationalisation strategy, CMC rebranded itself with a new name, Included, in 2012. Now, backed by fundraising offices in global centres such as Hong Kong, San Francisco, and London, CMC/Included is making an aggressive push into South Asia, and has added new operations in Dhaka and Kathmandu to its existing ones in Beijing and Shanghai.
These two case studies demonstrate that internationalisation is a serious priority for Chinese NGOs. Nonetheless, the processes and experiences of these two NGOs have vastly differed. The Chinese state’s support ensured that the CFPA was able to complete the Sudan hospital relatively quickly — in just over two years (opening in July 2011) — and the rapid pace at which this project was completed is highly indicative of not only the CFPA’s priorities but also those of the Chinese government. A former employee at the CFPA noted that the priorities of the organisation had to be realigned to those of the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC)—a Chinese state-owned oil company with operations in South Sudan—as the hospital is located in the region where the CNPC has its operations (Interview May 2012).
The CNPC’s financial support makes clear the interconnectedness between the state, state-owned companies, and NGOs, which has fuelled criticism that the Chinese have been profiting from oil exploitation in South Sudan for a number of years with the Sudanese have seen few benefits. Thus, such situations cast the CNPC and other state-owned companies in a negative light, which is incongruent with how the Chinese state desires to be seen image abroad. Consequently, the CFPA’s internationalisation strategy is on the one hand facilitated by the Chinese state’s desire to portray China as a friendly and pragmatic development actor, and on the other hand, it is a natural stage of the organisation’s development trajectory. The Sudan hospital not only dovetails with China’s foreign aid policy objectives but also the CFPA’s international ambitions.
The experience of Compassion for Migrant Children/Included has been vastly different than that of the CFPA, as government involvement had been at the local level and had occurred prior to CMC/Included’s foray abroad. CMC’s proactive strategy in pursuing collaboration with local Beijing authorities has resulted in mixed outcomes for the organisation. For example, CMC’s good relationships with the local authorities have led it to be granted the status to fundraise and issue tax receipts; however, despite their good relationships with the municipal government, changes in leadership at the top could have potentially make things difficult for them (Interview May 2012).
Various municipal departments sought clarification of CMC’s status during the municipal leadership change of 2012, but according to one senior representative, these inquiries have only served to strengthen the organisation because they have enabled CMC to re-establish itself at the forefront of the NGO sector in Beijing. The municipal authorities’ encroachment onto CMC’s working space is indicative of the management and control mentality at the central level; however, irrespective of the challenges from local authorities, CMC have been able to expand its operations to Dhaka and Kathmandu precisely because of the profile it has established in its first six years of operations.
The case studies presented in this article exhibit a dual-track process, whereby the nature of an NGO’s relationship with the Chinese state may very well determine the scale and scope of its work abroad. Clearly, the role of the Chinese state is an unavoidable factor for these NGOs, but to push our analytical boundaries, we need to assess which level of government is involved and what this means for an NGO’s work in an international setting.

Radio Free Asia: Tibetan Monk Detained, Vanishes in Custody

A Tibetan monk detained in June by police in southwestern China’s Sichuan province has vanished in custody, with authorities refusing to provide details of his whereabouts or any charges made against him, sources say.Lodroe, a monk enrolled at the Jonang monastery in Dzamthang (in Chinese, Rangtang) county, was seized by police on June 14 while walking with friends to buy food in neighboring Barkham (Ma'erkang) county, a Tibetan living in exile told RFA’s Tibetan Service on Tuesday.“He was taken away in handcuffs without explanation and has been held in custody ever since,” RFA’s source said, speaking on condition of anonymity and citing contacts in the region.“His monastery and family and relatives have repeatedly asked the authorities for information about him, but have never received any answers,” the source said.“Three months later, his whereabouts remain unknown,” he said.News of Lodroe’s detention was delayed in reaching outside contacts owing to communication blocks imposed by Chinese authorities in the area.Lodroe, 36, is a native of Ngatoe Tsida village in Sichuan’s Ngaba (Aba) county, RFA’s source said.“His father’s name is Tsikthok and his mother’s name is Dzokre.”“This is a very frustrating situation, and his family and relatives are deeply concerned about his welfare and current condition,” he said.Chinese authorities last year banned a two-week religious assembly at Dzamthang’s Jonang monastery during which the monastery’s 3,000 monks would have hosted formal debates on religious topics, sources told RFA in an earlier report.Jonang monastery had previously been the site of several self-immolation protests challenging Beijing’s rule in Tibetan areas, “which led to increasingly severe restrictions by the Chinese authorities,” one source said.Reported by Lhuboom for RFA’s Tibetan Service.

Sixth Tone: North or South? What’s Behind China’s Linguistic Rivalry
http://www.sixthtone.com/news/north-or-south-what%E2%80%99s-behind-china%E2%80%99s-linguistic-rivalry

Close your eyes, and you can’t guess her nationality. Lu Qiyu’s English is meticulous, sculpted over years of careful study. Though it remains slightly accented, the merest hint of a twang is difficult to place. 
Switch to Mandarin, however, and her southern Chinese accent emerges. In China, “north” and “south” are universally recognized as highly distinct regions, though no one is sure where exactly to draw the dividing line. The country’s diverse geography, history, and ethnic culture have led to the emergence of distinctive linguistic variations, even within standard Mandarin.
Mandarin spoken across the north — particularly the areas around Beijing and the northeast — is characterized most distinctively by the retroflex “r” affixed to the ends of words: For example, the word “hua,” meaning “flower,” becomes “huar.” Northerners also use the fifth, or neutral, tone more widely. 
This pronunciation contrasts with that of southern Chinese speakers. While the vast southern region is more linguistically diverse than the north — the area is dotted with dialects bearing little resemblance to Mandarin — in general, southern speakers of the standard language are more likely to eschew the retroflex; soften the consonants “s,” “sh,” “zh,” and “ch”; and, in some cases, struggle to differentiate between the “n” and “ng” sounds at the ends of syllables. 
Lu studies in Beijing and socializes mostly with northerners, but she refuses to adopt their pronunciation, even though northern Mandarin is closer to the official “standard” pronunciation. For example, she pronounces the word “xuesheng,” meaning “student,” as “xueshen,” omitting the “g.” She declines to change her pronunciation, even when it confuses me, her language exchange partner. 
“Xuesheng,” she intones to herself, concentrating as she applies the more accepted ending to the word as if taking the accent out for a test drive. She squints, furrows her brow. “I can’t; it’s too ugly.” She apologizes for using non-standard Mandarin in my presence but remains unbowed. “The southern accent is better.” 
Needless to say, most northerners don’t agree. In China, Mandarin pronunciation is one of several battlegrounds in a rivalry that spans several centuries. It has spawned viral videos, prolix internet conversations, and foreign media coverage. Even the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has intervened. Despite years of heated discussion, a winner has not yet been declared and probably never will be.
Every country has regional rivalries. The United States, for example, boasts north-south as well as east-west rivalries. At times, these contentions have grown intense: The 1990s New York City-Los Angeles rap rivalry, for example, led to gang warfare and the death of two of the country’s most talented performers. But even in the United States, there is little talk of a “standard American accent.” Regional identities are becoming increasingly fluid, too, as more young people grow up in one location, attend school in another, and work in yet another. The ongoing diversification of southern cities is one of U.S. demography’s most consequential phenomena.

In China, however, regional rivalry has deeper roots. In ancient times, imperial decline was often associated with regional warlordism. As a result, officials were precluded from forming regional patronage networks under the “rule of avoidance,” which forbade them from serving in their home provinces. In the 1800s, China was shaken by the Taiping, Nian, and Dungan rebellions. Though mostly ethnic and religious in origin, these uprisings drew on regional ties. Consequently, ancient and modern Chinese governments have tended to view strong regional identities with suspicion and, sometimes, alarm. Such regional loyalties have often presaged civil unrest. 
The CCP’s great achievement was to reunite the country under central rule. Politically, the central government in Beijing reestablished administrative control over the various provinces, including the historically rebellious Tibet Autonomous Region in the southwest and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the northwest. Ideologically, Maoist thought permeated all aspects of Chinese society, corralling competing strands of political thought into a unitary “People’s” Republic of China. Ubiquitous Little Red Books were but the physical manifestation of an extant ideological penetration. 
These achievements are well-known. Less well-known — but equally important — is that the CCP also managed linguistic standardization, for decades an elusive goal of Chinese reformers. At the National Conference on Script Reform in 1955, the CCP established Putonghua — based on the northern dialects, with Beijing pronunciation at its core — as Mandarin’s standard pronunciation. 
The decision marked the conclusion of a conflict that had simmered for decades between guoyin, a hybridized supra-regional Mandarin pronunciation, and jingyin, a Beijing-based Mandarin pronunciation. According to author Ping Chen’s “Modern Chinese,” a history of Chinese linguistics, even into the 1930s, Beijing Mandarin was considered by many to be “lower status” — belonging to “maids and laborers” — especially when compared with a third dialect, guanhua, the literary pronunciation of Chinese officials. Jingyin won a provisional victory in 1926, and in 1932 earned publication in the national dictionary. But it was only in the years following 1955, and especially after the reform and opening-up period, that Beijing Mandarin evolved into China’s shared language. Today, over 90 percent of Chinese people understand Putonghua. 
National unification diminished the sway of regional identity. Politically, Beijing has reigned uncontested over the provinces since 1949. Ideologically, the CCP has used one-country nationalism to buttress state power, diminishing regional ideologies in the process. And linguistically, the elevation of Beijing Mandarin has accelerated the erasure of hundreds of regional dialects, previously the most visible markers of regional identity. 
Yet paradoxically, national unification may also have enabled regional rivalries to survive. Politically and ideologically, of course, a rivalry can only exist within a system — just as sports teams cannot compete without a league. If a rivalry is defined as competition for the same objective or for superiority within the same field, then ideological unity is the shared objective, and a unified China is the shared field. Linguistically, a common language is crucial: Southerners and northerners must be able to speak to each other if they are to trade boasts.
In this historical context, Lu’s refusal to pronounce the “g” in “xuesheng” is but another salvo in the ancient feud between north and south, capital and provinces. It contests the superiority of Beijing Mandarin, but it does so from within the strictures of Beijing Mandarin itself — after all, she uttered her challenge in Putonghua, not Zhejiang dialect, the language of her home province in eastern China. 
If there is final proof that Chinese regional rivalries are, in the end, lighthearted in nature, it is foreigners’ participation in them. Foreigners without Chinese ancestry who are living in China do not have bloodline connections to any particular region and consequently have little reason to profess loyalty to one over another. Much like supporting a sports team in another country’s league, they simply choose a home team and cheer rabidly. 
I am one such fan: In recent months, I’ve swapped the “w” in “weishenme,” “why,” for a harder “v” sound, which hails from the northeast of China. When speaking in my second language, I usually choose to channel my inner northerner. And yet, I have noticed a troubling phenomenon. After spending a semester with Lu as my language partner, my Mandarin has changed. Whereas before, my “-en” and “-eng” sounds were distinct, recently they have blurred together. It seems I am migrating south.  
Some linguistic variety is healthy; it allows the Chinese language to innovate. With too much variety, however, communication becomes impossible. Northern Mandarin has won enshrinement as a closer approximation of standard Putonghua, but as a result, perhaps we ought to look south for innovation. It’s not a conclusion, but a compromise. The rivalry will continue.
