1. Open URL in chrome

2. add url to adder.txt

3. Make changes to adder.py
  the syntax for a more complicated one like:
  article = soup.find("div", {"class" : "entry"}).findAll('p')

  is "find all of the divs with a class=entry. once you have found that specific class, find all of the 'p' and iterate through until you have all of them"

  I think it is important that there is only one "findAll at the end.

4. Run adder.py until it works.

5. Copy from the "if" statement (line 40 as of this writing) through the "holder[headline_text] = article_text" line (line 67 as of this writing)

6. Paste that block below the last "elif" and before the "else" statement in china-daily-email-working.py. MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE 'if' from adder to "elif"

7. Add the url to the bottom of china-daily-email-stable.csv

8. Run china-daily-email-working.py to verify it works

9. Save china-daily-email-working.py as china-daily-email-stable.py

10. Upload china-daily-email-working.py to github and say what you added as the commit comment
